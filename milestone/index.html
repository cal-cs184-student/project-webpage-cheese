<p>
	So far, we have accomplished much of the preliminary work for the project. Our first week or so was spent mostly on getting fully acquainted with the homework 4 code base. Then we started adding our custom classes and integrating them with the existing code. We broke down the physics simulation into 6 individual steps, some of which we have finished and some of which we are still completing.
</p>

<p>
	Now, we are able to render and partially simulate Phyxels, which are particles representing the mass of the elastic body (cheese). We are also currently finishing up implementing the collision with external objects (plane). We have the plane rendering again and just need to finish the collision physics.
</p>

<p>
	Relative to our initial plan, we are pretty much on track to complete our goal though we will probably not have enough time to finish any of our stretch goals. Our goal was to finish the physical simulation by the midpoint, and work on rendering the surface after. Currently we are just about to finish the physical simulation and test/debug it. So we are technically slightly behind our original plan but are still confident we can get a realistic and well rendered simulation working for the final deliverable.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Work Plan</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>By Thursday April 24</strong>: Finish the physics simulation, including tuning a set of parameters that accurately simulates cheese.</li>
	<li><strong>By Tuesday April 29</strong>: Get a basic surface rendering working so we can have an MVP in case we are not able to get a more advanced rendering method working.</li>
	<li><strong>By May 2</strong>: Ideally have a more interesting and realistic rendering method working. Or, this time will be spent debugging.</li>
	<li><strong>On May 2â€“4</strong>: Squash any last bugs in the code and begin writing up/recording our deliverables.</li>
</ul>
